Project Summary: Temperature Prediction Using Linear Regression

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze a dataset containing various atmospheric and pollution-related metrics and to develop a simple machine learning model to predict temperature (T).

Dataset Description:
The dataset includes the following columns:
- Time: Timestamp of data collection.
- CO(GT): Concentration of Carbon Monoxide in the air.
- PT08.S1(CO), PT08.S2(NMHC), PT08.S3(NOx), PT08.S4(NO2), PT08.S5(O3): Sensor readings related to different gases.
- NMHC(GT): Non-methane hydrocarbons concentration.
- C6H6(GT): Benzene concentration.
- NOx(GT): Concentration of Nitrogen Oxides.
- NO2(GT): Concentration of Nitrogen Dioxide.
- T: Temperature.
- RH: Relative Humidity.
- AH: Absolute Humidity.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
The EDA process involved:
1. Initial Data Inspection: Displaying the first few rows, basic information, and summary statistics of the dataset.
2. Missing Values Analysis: Visualizing missing values using a heatmap.
3. Distribution Analysis: Plotting histograms for the temperature to understand its distribution.
4. Correlation Analysis: Creating a correlation matrix to explore relationships between variables.
5. Outlier Detection: Using boxplots to detect outliers in numeric columns.
6. Scatter Plots: Plotting scatter plots between temperature and other selected variables to visualize relationships.
7. Time Series Analysis: Plotting temperature over time to observe trends (if the Time column is available).

Model Development:
A Linear Regression model was chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness for predicting continuous values. The steps involved were:
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting the Time column to datetime, and selecting only numeric columns.
2. Feature and Target Selection: Defining the features (X) and target variable (y).
3. Train-Test Split: Dividing the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
4. Model Training: Training the Linear Regression model on the training set.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) on both training and testing sets, and visualizing the actual vs. predicted values.

Results:
The Linear Regression model provided a straightforward and interpretable baseline for predicting temperature based on various atmospheric and pollution-related features. The performance metrics and visualizations helped assess the model's accuracy and areas for potential improvement.

Future Work:
To enhance the model's performance, further steps could include:
- Feature engineering to create new informative features.
- Trying more complex models such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.
- Cross-validation to ensure robustness of the model.
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model parameters.

This project serves as an initial step in understanding and predicting temperature using environmental data, providing insights and laying the groundwork for more advanced modeling techniques.
